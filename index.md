This one-day workshop will be introduce the R programming language, a popular language for biologists, featuring many software packages that are suitable for exploring and plotting acoustic telemetry data (`dplyr` and `ggplot`). The second session offers a brief overview of the `glatos` R package for performing some of these same tasks using standard functions, and in the final session, we will have discussion of choosing an appropriate analysis for your telemetry data, and applying the knowledge gained from your studies to decision makers and to enhance public knowledge.
