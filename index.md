This one-day workshop begins with an overview of OTN and its role in aggregating telemetry data, an introduction to taking your records from fieldnotes to analysis ready data sets,
and where when and how to submit data and metadata to OTN. In the second session, you will be introduced to exploring and plotting acoustic telemetry data in R using dplyr and ggplot. The third session offers a brief overview of the `glatos` R package for performing some of these same tasks using standard functions, and in the final session, you'll get an introduction to statistical analysis of animal behavioural states using Hidden Markov models and the `moveHMM` R package.
