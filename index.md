This one-day workshop will introduce the R programming language, popular in the field of biologging, exploring some of the popular software packages suitable for exploring and plotting acoustic telemetry data, including `dplyr` and `ggplot`. Some specific attention will be paid to the spatial nature of telemetry datasets and a brief introduction to a newer package, `spdplyr`, that carries the `dplyr` workflow into spatial data objects. The second session offers a brief overview of the `glatos` R package for performing some of these same tasks using standard functions. In the final session, we will have guest speakers leading a series of discussions on choosing an appropriate analysis for your telemetry data, and applying the knowledge gained from your studies to decision makers and to enhance public knowledge.
