This pair of workshops will introduce the R programming language, popular in the field of biologging. 

In session one we will explore some of the popular software packages suitable for exploring and plotting acoustic telemetry data, including `dplyr` and `ggplot2`, for the purpose of generating summaries for reports. 

The second session offers a brief overview of the `glatos` R package for performing detection filtering, various calculations and plotting. The data is then transformed for ingestion into the powerful acoustic telemetry packages `VTrack` and `actel`. We will end off the second session with guest speakers Dr. Hugo Flavio who will introduce `actel` in more detail, and Dr. Charles Bangley who will introduce the learners to boosted regression trees and `gbm.auto`.

After the second session there will be an open Study Hall with all presenters, and members of the general public, to socialize and ask questions! Zoom link will be provided and all attendees are welcome! Email otndc@dal.ca if you've missed the link!
