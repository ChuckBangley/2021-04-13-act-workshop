This pair of workshops will introduce the R programming language, popular in the field of biologging. 

In session one we will explore some of the popular software packages suitable for exploring and plotting acoustic telemetry data, including `dplyr` and `ggplot2`, for the purpose of generating summaries for reports. 

The second session offers a brief overview of the `glatos` R package for performing detection filtering, various calculations and plotting. The data is then transformed for ingestion into the powerful acoustic telemetry packages `VTrack` and `actel`. We will end off the second session with guest speakers Dr. Hugo Flavio who will introduce `actel` in more detail, and Dr. Charles Bangley who will introduce the learners to boosted regression trees and `gbm.auto`.
