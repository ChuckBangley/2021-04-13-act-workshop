The ultimate goal of telemetry research is to answer questions about animals and their environment. These answers in turn inform decisions that can have significant ecological, social, and economic consequences. Here we'll learn how the goals of a telemetry project can be factored into preparation, field deployments, and analysis, and review some case studies of telemetry research informing decisions on fishery management, shipping, and other human interactions with the marine environment.
