The Ocean Tracking Network (OTN) supports global telemetry research by providing training, equipment, and data infrastructure to our large network of partners. The GLATOS Network continues to be an important OTN partner, now hosting a compatible Database Node and other cross-referencing tools. OTN supports GLATOS through the collaborative development of the glatos R package and training by means of annual workshops as part of the GLATOS Annual Coordination Meeting.
