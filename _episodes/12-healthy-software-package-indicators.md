* How do I learn the right way to use them?
    - vignettes that are legible and show me how this package fits my workflow
* Checking the Pulse of a Package
    - Open source? Regular updates? Tickets being submitted, addressed, and resolved?
* Can I cite this thing?
    - Does it have a version number? An introductory publication / white paper? a vignette that describes the preferred citation method?
