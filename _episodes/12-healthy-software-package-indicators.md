### How do I find packages to use?
* CRAN?        https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_date.html
* GitHub?      https://github.com/RossDwyer/VTrack
* literature reviews?  https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.13116 (Joo et al, 2019)

### How do I learn the right way to use them?
* **Vignettes** that are legible and show how this package fits your intended workflow
* How can I read the source of a function in a package, if I want to confirm that it's doing what I expect?

### Should I keep this? 
Checking the Pulse of a Package
* Open source? 
* Regular updates? 
* Tickets being submitted, addressed, and resolved?

### Can I cite this?
You'll want to cite the exact version of any complex software package thatr you're depending on heavily so others can reproduce your work.
* Does it have a version number? 
    * CRAN will enforce this. 
    * If it's not on CRAN, does it tag versions for reference? e.g: https://gitlab.oceantrack.org/GreatLakes/glatos/-/releases
* Does it have an introductory publication / white paper? a vignette that describes the preferred citation method? e.g. http://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2006.03.017

### What's most important to the user?
* Maslow's Hierarchy of Software Package Needs
    * Stanley Siebert of the Anaconda Project updated a very familiar diagram with what is important to software developers adopting new software into their workflows.
    * These priorities will also help you and the people who follow after you to implement and carry forward  the scripts/code/packages you will one day build.
