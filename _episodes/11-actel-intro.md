`actel` is designed for studies where animals tagged with acoustic tags are expected to move through receiver arrays. `actel` combines the advantages of automatic sorting and checking of animal movements with the possibility for user intervention on tags that deviate from expected behaviour. The three analysis functions: explore, migration and residency, allow the users to analyse their data in a systematic way, making it easy to compare results from different studies.
